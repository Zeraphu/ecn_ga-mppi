# ECN M1 group project: Mixing MPPI with genetic algorithms
Currently, the repo is divided into branches such that:
1. `main` branch will include the actual MPPI controller and its params.
2. `underwater-rov` branch will include its model class, its cost function and other params.
3. `unicycle` branch ^ same but for unicycle.

The 'Projects' section will include all the tasks and task allocation. And the 'Wiki' section can include all the useful links and other info, if needed. (TODO)
