# ECN M1 group project: Mixing MPPI with genetic algorithms
Currently, the repo is divided into branches such that:
1. `main` branch will include the actual MPPI controller and its params.
2. `underwater-rov` branch will include its model class, its cost function and other params.
3. `unicycle` branch ^ same but for unicycle.

The [Projects](https://github.com/users/Zeraphu/projects/2/views/1) section will include all the tasks and task allocation. And the [Wiki](https://github.com/Zeraphu/ecn_ga-mppi/wiki) section can include all the useful links and other info, if needed. (TODO)
